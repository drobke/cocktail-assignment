# cocktail-coding-challenge
This is the coding challenge used for frontend developers technical interviews. 
The candidates may choose if they want to

* prepare the assignment at home (max. 1 week ahead of the interview, they shouldn't invest more than 3 hours)
* come unprepared and code live for 2 hours

## Live Coding
* Less time consuming for the candidate
* Generous judgement from us, we don't put every mistake or sloppyness on the scale.
  As long as candidates can say how to do something cleanly (if more time was available), we are happy.
* Both candidate and the hiring team get a good impression of each other. We should both be able to feel how every-day work would be.
* More stressful for the candidates, but also more insightful for both sides.

## Prepare at home, present and review live
* More time consuming for the candidate
* Suitable for introverted that would get very nervous in a live coding scenario
* Expect picky questions around your code
* Expect to be asked to perform a few minor changes live, so we get an impression of your setup and working style.
