# cocktail-coding-challenge

## Preparation

You must bring a laptop with typescript, node, npm etc. installed.
A reasonable internet connection is also required for the interview, as we don't want for npm to download dependencies. Needless to say that you should have your favourite IDE installed and configured.

## About the challenge
This assignment is a straight forward backend task, nothing complicated or difficult. You can prepare it at home, or work on in a live coding session (2 hours) together with some future team mates. For us, it's more insightful to see you code live. We'll reward your courage with a very generous judgement, as we're aware about the stressful situation for you. If you're stuck or going into the wrong direction, we'll help you out. You may also use the internet for anything you like. Please keep talking while coding, tell us if you think that something is ugly and in real life you would do it differently. The more we understand your thought processes, the better the impression we get about you and your skills.

The live coding agenda is:

1. Introduction of people, explanation of the challenge (15 minutes)
2. Start working, with the screen shared (45 minutes)
3. Break (5 minutes)
4. Continue working (30 minutes)
5. Review (20 minutes)

Prepared tech challenges are shorter (about 30 minutes), consisting mainly of a demonstration and question round. But the code will be reviewed more strictly by us. The assignment must be finished, please let us know in advance if you can't make it. You'll get the project up to 1 week before the interview, and you shouldn't invest more than 3 hours to prepare it.
